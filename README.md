# Listed AI/ML Engineer - Intern Technical Assignment

Hi there, this is my submission for the Listed AI/ML Engineer - Intern technical assignment. In this repository, you'll find my work on the lip-syncing AI model task.

## Assignment Details

The objective of this assignment was to create an AI model proficient in lip-syncing, i.e., synchronizing an audio file with a video file. The goal was to ensure that the model accurately matched the lip movements of the characters in the given video file with the corresponding audio file. And I have tried my best with the

Here are the resources for the task:

* [Video file](https://openinapp.co/5cwva)
* [Audio file](https://openinapp.co/o9vuj)
* [Wav2Lip](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip) - It is suggested to explore this for the task

## Repository Contents

1. **inference.py**: An edited file from the Wav2Lip GitHub repository where I handled frames with no faces detected.
2. **assignment1.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the actual implementation of the task.
3. **demo.mp4**: A complete demo of the notebook implementation.
